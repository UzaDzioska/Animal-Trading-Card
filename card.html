			<p>The honey badger is part of the weasel family, related to skunks, otters, ferrets, and other badgers.
				Its proper name is ratel, but it gets the common name honey badger from what seems to be its favorite food: honey.
				 Yet what the animal is actually looking to eat are the bee larvae found in the honey! (sandiegozoo.org)</p>
